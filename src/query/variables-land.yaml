variables:
  Dew Point Temperature:
    units: K
    short_name: dew_point_temperature
    description: "Dew point temperature is the temperature at which a parcel of air reaches saturation upon being cooled at constant pressure and specific humidity. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily)"
  Accumulated Precipitation:
    units: mm
    short_name: accumulated_precipitation
    description: "Accumulated precipitation over specified period. (Available at frequencies: daily, monthly)"
  Fresh Snow:
    units: mm
    short_name: fresh_snow
    description: "New snow accumulated between consecutive observations or over reporting period. (Available at frequencies: daily)"
  Snow Depth:
    units: cm
    short_name: snow_depth
    description: "Vertical distance from the snow surface to the underlying surface (ground, glacier ice or sea ice). (Available at frequencies: daily)"
  Snow Water Equivalent:
    units: mm
    short_name: snow_water_equivalent
    description: "Surface snow amount. (Available at frequencies: daily, monthly)"
  Air Pressure:
    units: Pa
    short_name: air_pressure
    description: "Pressure of air column at specified height. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily)"
  Air Pressure At Sea Level:
    units: Pa
    short_name: air_pressure_at_sea_level
    description: "Sea level means mean sea level,  which is close to the geoid in sea areas. Air pressure at sea level is the quantity often abbreviated as MSLP or PMSL. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily)"
  Air Temperature:
    units: K
    short_name: air_temperature
    description: "Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air,  not the surface (skin) temperature. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily, daily, monthly)"
  Wind From Direction:
    units: degree
    short_name: wind_from_direction
    description: "Direction from which the wind is blowing Lot 1 uses dd  - WMO abbrev. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily, daily)"
  Wind Speed:
    units: m s-1
    short_name: wind_speed
    description: "Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector,  with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward air velocity.) The wind speed is the magnitude of the wind velocity. Lot 1 uses ff  - WMO abbrev. (Available at frequencies: sub-daily, daily, monthly)"
