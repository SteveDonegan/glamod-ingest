variables:
  Dew Point Temperature:
    units: K
    short_name: dew_point_temperature
    description: Dew point temperature is the temperature at which a parcel of air reaches saturation upon being cooled at constant pressure and specific humidity.
  Air Pressure At Sea Level:
    units: Pa
    short_name: air_pressure_at_sea_level
    description: Sea level means mean sea level,  which is close to the geoid in sea areas. Air pressure at sea level is the quantity often abbreviated as MSLP or PMSL.
  Air Temperature:
    units: K
    short_name: air_temperature
    description: Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air,  not the surface (skin) temperature.
  Water Temperature:
    units: K
    short_name: water_temperature
    description: Water (sea, river, lake) temperature at depth indicated
  Wind From Direction:
    units: degree
    short_name: wind_from_direction
    description: Direction from which the wind is blowing Lot 1 uses dd  - WMO abbrev.
  Wind Speed:
    units: m s-1
    short_name: wind_speed
    description: Speed is the magnitude of velocity. Wind is defined as a two-dimensional (horizontal) air velocity vector,  with no vertical component. (Vertical motion in the atmosphere has the standard name upward air velocity.) The wind speed is the magnitude of the wind velocity. Lot 1 uses ff  - WMO abbrev.
